Express is by far the most popular micro framework for building backend applications with JavaScript.

This tutorial will guide you step by step, explaining **how to build an express application from scratch**. It's targeted toward complete beginners but expects a few **prerequisites** (listed in the first exercise).

In the first part of the tutorial, we focus on **really learning** the core concepts and learning to build a very basic application **quick and dirty**. In later lessons, we'll dive into more advanced but very common topics. You'll learn to bring your code to the **next level** by writing higher-quality code.
