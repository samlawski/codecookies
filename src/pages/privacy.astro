      <h2>How this website works</h2>
      <p>The Code Cookies website is a <strong>static website</strong>. The Code Cookies developers are not running any server-side code or data processing of incoming requests. This also means Code Cookies <strong>does not process or store any data</strong> of individual users.</p>
      <p>The website is hosted on <strong>Vercel</strong>. For processing of data such as server access logs etc. please refer to their <a href="https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> for further details.</p>

      <h2>Cookies, user data, and tracking</h2>
      <p>There are no tracking or marketing cookies set by Code Cookies. The only cookie that is set comes from the user clicking on this cookie Emoji <span id="jsCookie">🍪 </span>. The cookie itself does not contain any information beyond the emoji character.</p>
      <p>To see all the cookies currently set on this website click the following button: <button onclick="viewCookies()">View cookies</button></p>
      <p id="jsViewCookies"></p>

      <p>Code Cookies uses an <strong>open-source, light-weight, anonymous, and cookie-free</strong> analytics system called <strong>Swetrix</strong> (<a href="https://swetrix.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>) to keep track generally of how many users are accessing which page of the website from which country. None of the tracked information can be used to identify individual users.</p>
