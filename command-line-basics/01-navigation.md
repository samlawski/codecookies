The command line is a way for you to interact with your computer using just text commands (kind of like in a text-adventure). 

Every operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) has its own version of it. You may have heard of it as the **Terminal**, **Powershell**, **bash**, **shell**, **command prompt**.

All these terms refer to the command line in one way or another. On macOS you access the command line most commonly using the preinstalled **Terminal** application. On Windows 10, the most common way to work with the command line is the **Powershell**.

The main commands you should know about are:

- `ls` - View folders and files of the directory I am currently in
- `pwd` - See the full path of the directory I'm currently in
- `mkdir name` - Create a new directory and give it a name (replace "name" with the directory name you'd like)
- `rmdir` - Delete an empty directory
- `cd path` - Move into another directory. Replace "path" with the name of the directory you want to move into or write `..` to move into the parent directory
