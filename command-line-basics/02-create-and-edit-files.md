Most operating systems come with some powerful tools pre-installed to help you edit files right from the command line.

One of those tools is called **vi** or **vim**. Another one is called **nano**.

Vim/Vi is a very powerful text editor right in the command line loved and used by many developers. It is however quite hard to get into and has a steep learning curve. An easier alternative is **nano**. 

To create a new file from your text editor just type in `touch name` where "name" is the name of your file, e.g. `touch readme.txt`. 

You can then open the file and edit it by typing `nano readme.txt`. The nice thing about nano is that it displays the short cuts for what you can do with it right at the bottom of the screen. 

One important thing to know, though is that `^` refers to the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key on your keyboard.
