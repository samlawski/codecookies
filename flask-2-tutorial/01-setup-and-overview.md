Welcome to a short series on learning how to build Flask web applications! ðŸ‘‹

Flask is a micro-framework. That means, it has a whole bunch of pre-written code ready for you to use to build a web application. It'll handle a lot of the work (like routing, templating) for you you'd otherwise have to build from scratch. 

Larger frameworks like Django or Ruby on Rails additionally have very opinionated rules on the folder structure of your project. Flask is less restrictive. But that also means that it requires a little more code you have to write yourself. But that's perfect for beginners as it'll help you better understand the structure of a web backend. 

## Prerequisites

To keep this course focused, I'll assume you have some previous knowledge. If any of the following topics seem foreign to you make sure to catch up on them before continueing with this tutorial. 

* Using the command line
* Using git
* How the internet works (client-server relationship)
* HTML (CSS, and JavaScript are optional but helpful)
* Python (particularly functions, for-loops, object-oriented programming with classes)

## Setup

To get started create a virtual environment as [described here](/python/virtual-environment).

Make sure to create a .gitignore file and include the `venv` folder in it. 

Don't forget to **activate** the environment. Then, install Flask with `pip install flask`.

## Create a Flask app

A Flask app can be as simple as a single Python file. Most larger projects benefit from multiple files. But as we just start learning it can be helpful to have it all in one place to understand how everything is connected a little better. Later in the course, you'll learn to split up your application into multiple files. That's actually considered best practice and will help you a lot as your project grows. 

But for now create a **app.py** file. In it import Flask like so: 

```py
from flask import Flask
```

This imports the class `Flask` from the package you just installed called `flask`. (It actually matters whether it's lowercase or uppercase! Usually, in Python, when a variable starts with a uppercase letter, it usually means it's a class.)

Now, we want to create an instance of that `Flask` class. So, below the import add: 

```py
app = Flask(__name__)
```

First, we assign a variable called `app`. We'll use that variable throughout our code to interact with the Flask app framework. Then, we create an instance of the `Flask` class with `Flask()`. This means, app will represent all the class methods defined by the framework Flask and we'll be able to use a lot of feature like `routing`. 

`__name__` is a variable provided by Python. It's not related to Flask but available in all Python programs. It represents a string and tells the Flask framework which file of your code is the main file. Right now it's not extremely necessary. But it will be as your app grows. So it's best practice to just have it in there from the beginning. More details on that you can find [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html?highlight=__name__)

Now, we have Flask initialized. But it doesn't actually do much yet. 

## Creating a first route

You'll learn more about routes in the future. But in short, routes define the paths a client can enter for example in the web browser to access your backend. Without routes your backend is not available to the public.

To create a route we can start by defining a Python function that returns some text. Add: 

```py
def index():
  return 'Hello World!'
```

This function just returns some text "Hello World!". I named the function `index` because in web development you usually name the start page of your web application `index`. The name of the function could be anything you like though. 

Right now it's just a function, though. To connect it to the Flask app we need to add a _decorator_. Right above the `index()` function add `@app.route('/')`. This is what it should look like: 

```py
@app.route('/')
def index():
  return 'Hello World!'
```

[Decorators](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator) are a feature of the Python language but not always well known. Take a moment to read up on them if you're new to the concept. 
In short, they allow you to chain functions. What will happen here is that whenever a user accesses your web app at the route `/` (which is just the domain name without any path added to it - so e.g. `codecookies.xyz/`), some magic Flask code will be executed hidden behind the `app.route()` method. But because it's a decorator, the `app.route()` method will execute some code **together with whatever your `index()` function returns**.

## Starting a server

Now that we have a route defined, the last step is to actually run our app as a web server. Flask comes with a simple server pre-installed. To make use of it add `app.run()` at the end of your Python file. 

Now, you can just execute the python file with `python app.py` and should see a server running. It'll tell you that you can now access your server using the link [127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). You can just type in that IP in the browser and should see "Hello World" show up.

## Config and Environment Variables

Right now, you'd have to restart your server every time you make a change in your code. That's a little tedious. Also, you may have noticed a little warning that tells you not to use the server in production. You see that warning because your Flask app doesn't know yet that it's being executed on a development environment (your local computer).

To fix both those things, we can define an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) that tells our app that we are in a development environment. _(Environment variables are variables defined **outside** of your project code, globally on a machine, your computer or a server - aka "environment". Because they're not defined in your project but on the environment istself you can set an environment variable to "Development" on your own computer and define the same variable as "Production" or "live" on a server. This way, your code knows where it's being executed. Environment variables can also be used if you want to have a different key/password or link to a database on your server than you have on your local computer.)_

There are many ways to define environment variables. But one way is to use the `python-dotenv` package.

Install it, running `pip install python-dotenv`. To make use of the package, we're going to create a separate config file. 

Create a file called **config.py**. In it, import `load_dotenv` from `dotenv` and execute that function. It should look like this: 

```py
from dotenv import load_env

load_dotenv()
```

We can use this file later on for other configurations if we need it. 

Now, we need to tell Flask how to find the configuration. Flask has actually a built-in method to do that. Back in your **app.py** file, underneath the line where you instantiate the `Flask()` class, add a new line:

```py
app.config.from_object('config')
```

This tell Flask where to find your config file. The `'config'` is the name of the config file. If the file was named `configuration.py` you should pass `'configuration'` as a parameter.

Now, we can actually create a **.env** file in our project folder. In it, add the line: 

```
FLASK_ENV=development
```

`FLASK_ENV` is a prefedined variable that Flask will automatically look for. If it's set to `development` Flask knows we're in a development environment. On your server, you could set it to `production`. 

Lastly, it's very important that your **.env** file is not part of your git repository. So make sure to add it in a new line to your **.gitignore** file. Many people store passwords and keys in the .env file later on. Those should never show up in your repository. 

## Side Note: gitignore pycache

As soon as you start importing different files (aka modules), you may see a folder called **__pycache__** show up in your project. That folder contains some caching files (as you might have guessed) and is not relevant for your code. So you should also add a line with `__pycache__` in it to your **.gitignore** file to keep your code clean.

## Restart the server

That's it. You have set up your Flask application. You can now stop the server with the keys Ctrl + C. Then, start it again with `python app.py`. From now on, whenever you make changes, the server will automatically reload. 

## ðŸ›   Practice 

As you go through the tutorials, I recommend you follow along and write the code as you go through the material. Don't copy and paste but type everything by hand. 

Once you have completed an exercse and written the tutorial code, I recommend you spend some time to practice what you have learned.

This section was about setting up a Flask project from scratch. To practice that a little more, set up a couple more projects completely from scratch (including the virtual environment). 

_Whenever you start a new project, make sure you're not still within the active environment of another project!!_ To deactivate the environment simply type `deactivate` in your command line and hit "Enter".
